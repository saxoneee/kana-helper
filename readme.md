# kana helper

for those who want to write some hiragana/katakana without a japanese keyboard

based on android hiragana keyboard

only tested in chrome for windows and android

## usage

* focus textarea
* use num block and arrow keys for typing
    * example: hold 7 and use arrows to choose char
* use minus (-) on num block to change between hiragana and katakana
* https://saxoneee.github.io/kana-helper/dist/
* sadly, no pasting in the textarea is possible and no cursor is shown :/

## dev

* run `npm install` once
* run `npm run dev`
* open http://localhost:8000/

## todo

* better way than readonly to disable mobile keyboard 
* katakana: ヵ, ヶ
* kanji: 々
* add structure
* proper build system
